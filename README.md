# UnrealEmpire

This is an unreal version of what was originally a Raspberry Pi project from a bunch of years ago. 
Point is to make a rudimentary simulation of one or more empires colonizing worlds in a galaxy.
Gives me an opportunity to implement funkly algorithms to solve problems like path finding, traveling salesman & procedural generation.
